Born and raised in Tokyo, Japan, Kaho has been making waves on the cosplay, convention, and idol scene! She has released several of her own cosplay artbooks, is a former host on the YouTube channel “Omochan,” hosts her own radio show, writes columns for multiple publications, and is an accomplished author as well. Her first Japanese-only book, "Everything Girls Should Know About The JAV Industry", is being translated, repurposed, and soon published for her English-speaking audience! She's even working on her second book, soon to be released in Japan. Her debut idol single "Electric Town," a collaboration with Around Akiba was released in 2021, with some new singles on the way in 2022!

Kaho is excited to make her Pacific Northwest debut at Northwest IdolFest! Follow her on Twitter and Instagram @shibukaho to keep up-to-date with her appearances throughout the weekend!
